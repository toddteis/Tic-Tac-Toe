# Tic-Tac-Toe
A JavaScript project from The Odin Project curriculum Full Stack JavaScript pathway

Objective: Create the Tic Tac Toe game utilising Javascript Factory & Module patterns. Must have very few or no global variables.

Utilised: Factory & Module patterns, DOM Maniplulation, CSS Grid & Flexbox.

What I learnt: I really enjoyed the challenge of breaking the game down into logical modules and building each module as an API.
